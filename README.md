## Question: 

A farmer records the milk production of a herd of cows. Every cow has a unique 3-digit identity code. Each cow can be milked twice a day, seven days a week. The volume of milk from each cow is recorded in litres correct to one decimal place (yield) every time the cow is milked. The size of the herd is fixed. At the end of the week the total and the average yield for each cow for that week is calculated.

Write a program for TASK 1 to record the milk yields for a week. The program records and stores the identity code number and the yield every time a cow is milked.

### Output 

```
